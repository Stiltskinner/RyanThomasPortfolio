This is my first draft of a portfolio website. Currently, it includes placeholders for projects (under the work section), and placeholder links in the top-right nav-bar.

It has the basic layout completed, although it needs some adjustments that I will make once I learn more about using flexboxes properly. It still needs to have @media queries for different screen sizes, as well as titles for the placeholder "projects."

It contains links to my github profile, linkedin, and email.

It has basic animation on hovering over each project to add a box shadow.
