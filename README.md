## Collaborators 
Danny Yates-His code helped me understand how to put an anchor tag around a div, so that I could make an image with text into a link. His github repo I referenced:https://github.com/cycoconutz/Portfolio

This is my first draft of a portfolio website. Currently, it includes placeholders for projects (under the work section), and placeholder links in the top-right nav-bar.

The top features a header with my name and a navbar that includes internal links to the about me section, the work section, and the contact me section. It also has a resume link that downloads my resume.

Below that is a hero with a banner image. This is a placeholder until I get a good horizontal picture with myself taking up a small portion of the left side of the frame

After that is the main section, which has a sidebar labeling the different sections (About Me, Work, and Contact Me). To the right of each aside in those sections is a filler text to be replaced with my bio, several placeholder images inside anchors that link to my github. These will eventually be replaced with actual projects I completed. These images have a shadow glow animation on mouse hover.

After that, the Contact Me section has links to email me, to my github profile, and to my linkedin.

There are media queries to resize various flexboxes and text and change flex direction from row to column for the navbars, as well as a few other tweaks to make it friendlier at a smaller size.
